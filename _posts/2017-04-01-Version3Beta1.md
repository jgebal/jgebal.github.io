Version 3 has reached beta state.

It can be downloaded from the [releases page.](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/releases)

It's being used now in multiple organizations with great success.   The documentation work is progressing.  However, we realize that quite a bit of work needs to be done in this area. 

Feel free to join us in our [slack chat room](https://join.slack.com/t/utplsql/shared_invite/zt-xwm68udy-4cF_3PNEyczYEbWr38W5ww) where we communicate daily about the project.

We welcome support requests and discussions, feature requests, and bug reports in the [GitHub issues log](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/issues).

This is not an April Fools Day Joke,  we really release it.
