Today at [#apexConn19](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apexConn19&src=typd).

[Sam Nitsche](https://twitter.com/Der_Pesse) (blogger, presenter, testing & compassionate-coding advocate, utPLSQL-cli & utPLSQL-api developer) met with [Kris Rice](https://twitter.com/krisrice) (Oracle SQLDeveloper, sqlcl, ORDS rock-star, developer, advocate, presenter, mentor) 

As a result, something amazing happened. Within an hour or so, Kris created a fully functional auto-runner for utPLSQL tests within Oracle sqlcl.

If you want to use sqlcl to run your tests, each time you compile a package, have a look at [this script](https://github.com/krisrice/sqlcl-utplsql) for sqlcl.


**Huge thank you to Kris and Sam!**
