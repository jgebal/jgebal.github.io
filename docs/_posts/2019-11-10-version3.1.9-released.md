# Changes in release 3.1.9

## New features

- Added ability to define [nested contexts](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/blob/v3.1.9/docs/userguide/annotations.md#context) within test suite [#938](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/issues/938)
- Added ability to [exclude tests/suites by tags](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/blob/v3.1.9/docs/userguide/annotations.md#excluding-testssuites-by-tags) when invoking a test-run [#1007](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/issues/1007) [#983](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/issues/983)
- Added new annotation [`--%name`](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/blob/v3.1.9/docs/userguide/annotations.md#name) to allow for providing custom name for contexts [#1016](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/issues/1016)

## Important changes

The value of `--%context` annotation is no longer representing context `name`.
This value is now context description (displayname).
With this change, the `--%context` annotation is now aligned with `--%test` and `--%suite` annotation syntax.

New annotation `--%name` was introduced to facilitate naming of contexts.
