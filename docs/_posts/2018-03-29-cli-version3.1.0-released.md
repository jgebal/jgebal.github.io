------------------------------------

[Release download page](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL-cli/releases/tag/v3.1.0)
[Readme](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL-cli/blob/v3.1.0/README.md)

### Requirements

- [Java8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
- Oracle JDBC driver file (ojdbc8.jar) is required    
- Oracle i18n driver file (orai18n.jar) is required for national character-set support

Both driver files need to be [downloaded](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-ucp-122-3110062.html) and placed in `utPLSQL-cli/lib` folder


### Compatibility

This version of java-api is compatible with all versions of utPLSQL from 3.0.0 to 3.1.0. 
We encourage you to always use the latest version of cli to communicate with a v3 core.
