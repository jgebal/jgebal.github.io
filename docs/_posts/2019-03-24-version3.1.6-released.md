# Bugfix release for `v3.1.5`

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in release `3.1.5` where `to_equal` matcher was failing due to privileges when comparing non sql diffable types #870

## Improvements
- Reduced number of information displaying about user defined type. We will now display only type name instead of full structure #866
