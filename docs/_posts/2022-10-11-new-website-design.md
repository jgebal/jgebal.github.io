Today is [#JoelKallmanDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoelKallmanDay?f=live)
As memorandum of Joel Kallman, on this day utPLSQL launched its new website using different engine.

We have moved away from using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with GitHub Pages to host project and organization sites.
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was simply too much hussle and we used [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate offline documentation for utPLSQL that was packaged into the release zip file.

So instead of using two different methods, wei will now use only one. [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is now used for both utPSLQL offline and for online organization and project pages.

Thanks to wonderful [material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike)(versioning plugin) for MkDocs you may now enjoy the following new features:

- dark & light theme
- better navigation and menu in utPLSQL documentation
- documentation version dropdown
- powerful and fast search within documentation
 
Hopefully, you will like the changes and enhancements. All the permanent links to old site should still be working.
